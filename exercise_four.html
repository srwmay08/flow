            Calvinball (http://www.picpak.net/calvin/oldsite/images/oogy.gif) is a game with a very complicated scoring system. Your job is to write a piece of code which determines the winner of a game.
            
            Provided below are three different player's scores. Uncomment one at a time to calculate the score for that player.
            
            Calvinball Rules:
                1. A player's score is equal to 500 if their score is not already a number. (this is implemented below).
                2. 
                3. 
                4. 
                5. 
                6. 
        */
        
    /*
        //Player One
        var score = 193;
        var last_play = "Q";
        var broom = "handle";
        var has_ball = false;
        var is_in_tree = false;
        var crying = false;

// Rule 1
        if (typeof(score) != "number") {
            score = 500;
        }
// Rule 2 - A player's score is reduced by 300 if they are crying. Otherwise it is increased by 50.
		if (crying) {
			score = score - 300
			console.log(score);
		} else {
			score = score + 50
			console.log(score);
		}
// Rule 3 - A player's score is reduced by 77 if their last play was "Q"
		if (last_play == "Q") {
			score = score - 77
			console.log(score)
		}
// Rule 4 - A player gets an extra 395 points if they are in a tree, unless their last play was a number.
		if (is_in_tree) {
			if (typeof(last_play) != "number") {
				score = 395 + score
				console.log(score);
			}
		}
// Rule 5 - A player's score is doubled if they are holding the broom handle, but it is tripled if they have the broom brush. Otherwise the player's score is halved.
		if (broom == "handle") {
			score = score * 2
			console.log(score);
		} else if (broom == "brush") {
			score = score * 3
			console.log(score);
		} else {
			score = score / 2
			console.log(score);
		}
		
// Rule 6 - A player's score is multiplied by 1.5 if they are carrying the ball but only if they are not in a tree. Disregard this rule if the player is crying.
		if (!crying) {
			if (!is_in_tree) {
				if (has_ball) {
					score = score * 1.5
					console.log(score);
				}
			}
		}
		
// PART 7 - If the player's last play was a number (not a letter), the player's score is multiplied by that amount.
		if (typeof(last_play) != "number") {
			console.log("Last play was not a number");
			console.log(score)
		} else {
			score = score * last_play;
			console.log(score);
		}

// Player 1: 332, Player 2: 419.5, Player 3: 900
